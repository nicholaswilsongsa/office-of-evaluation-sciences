## What was the challenge?

Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) allow federal employees to contribute up to $2600 in pre-tax dollars each year for eligible medical expenses, a benefit that can  yield savings of up to $949 per year for employees seeking to manage health care costs. Yet fewer than half of employees participate, potentially losing out on savings on medical expenses.

## What was the program change?

We designed separate email newsletters highlighting the existence of FSAs, the percent return on savings, and the absolute return on savings, and sent these to GSA employees at the beginning of the federal benefits open enrollment period.

## How did the evaluation work?

Employees were randomly assigned to one of four study arms, with approximately 2800 employees in each arm. Individuals in the first intervention arm received a targeted communication about the benefits of FSAs delivered via the email newsletter GSA Today; individuals in the second arm received a communication that also highlighted their potential  savings (“save $949 over the course of a year”); and individuals in the third arm received  a communication that highlighted their potential savings in relative terms (“save 30%”). In the fourth, control arm, employees received no targeted communication about FSAs. GSA Human Resources collects information on enrollment in FSAs and employee contributions as part of their benefits management for employees.This information was used to track the effects of the targeted communication on FSA enrollment rates.

## What was the impact?

The results indicate that targeted communications around FSA enrollment did not lead to increased enrollment. Enrollment in FSAs was 30.2% in the control group and 30.1% in the pooled treatment arms. The average amount contributed is $656.49 in the control group and $656.06 in the pooled treatment arms. Heterogeneity analyses by treatment arm did not reveal noticeable differences by treatment arm.
