summary: Targeted email outreach to GSA employees did not increase enrollment in Flexible Spending Accounts.

## What was the challenge?
Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) allow employees to contribute up to $2600 in pre-tax dollars each year for eligible medical expenses, a benefit that can yield savings of up to $949 per year for employees seeking to manage health care costs.  Yet fewer than one-third of GSA employees participate in a FSA. 

## What was the program change?
We designed separate email newsletters highlighting the existence of FSAs (“save money”), the percent return on savings (“save 30%”), and the absolute return on savings (“save $949), and sent these to GSA employees at the beginning of the federal benefits open enrollment period.

## How did the evaluation work?
Employees were randomly assigned to one of four study arms, with approximately 2800 employees in each arm.  GSA Human Resources collects information on enrollment in FSAs and employee contributions as part of their benefits management for employees. This information was used to track the effects of the targeted communication on FSA enrollment rates.

## What was the impact?
The results indicate that targeted communications around FSA enrollment did not lead to increased enrollment rates and did not lead to increased FSA contribution amounts.
